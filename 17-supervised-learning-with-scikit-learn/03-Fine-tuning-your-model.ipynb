    "Having trained your model, your next task is to evaluate its performance. What metrics can you use to gauge how good your model is? So far, you have used accuracy for classification and R-squared for regression. In this chapter, you will learn about some of the other metrics available in scikit-learn that will allow you to assess your model's performance in a more nuanced manner. You will then learn to optimize both your classification as well as regression models using hyperparameter tuning.\n",

    "In Chapter 1, you evaluated the performance of your k-NN classifier based on its accuracy. However, as Andy discussed, accuracy is not always an informative metric. In this exercise, you will dive more deeply into evaluating the performance of binary classifiers by computing a confusion matrix and generating a classification report.\n",

    "You may have noticed in the video that the classification report consisted of three rows, and an additional _support_ column. The _support_ gives the number of samples of the true response that lie in that class - so in the video example, the support was the number of Republicans or Democrats in the test set on which the classification report was computed. The _precision_, _recall_, and _f1-score_ columns, then, gave the respective metrics for that particular class.\n",

    "Here, you'll work with the [PIMA Indians](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes) dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict whether or not a given female patient will contract diabetes based on features such as BMI, age, and number of pregnancies. Therefore, it is a binary classification problem. A target value of `0` indicates that the patient does _not_ have diabetes, while a value of `1` indicates that the patient _does_ have diabetes. As in Chapters 1 and 2, the dataset has been preprocessed to deal with missing values.\n",
